# What is Home HMI
Home HMI is a project created for the Technology Student Association event of Microcontroller design.
This years theme was to create a smart home device. We decided to create a Human Machine Interface that
works in function with smart home devices as a smart home. The device monitors sensor datas and allows the user
to perform various functions. The devices backbone is an Espressif Microcontroller and works in function with a
Nextion HMI display.

The project will first be displayed at the NJTSA State Competition in juncture with NJTSA at TCNJ.
